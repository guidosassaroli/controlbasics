# controlbasics

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook examples that demonstrate **fundamental control system techniques** using Python. It is designed for students, educators, and enthusiasts looking to explore and understand classic and modern control strategies through interactive simulations and visualizations.

## Contents

Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific control technique. Here's a list of what you'll find:

| Technique | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **PID Control** | Classic proportional-integral-derivative controller tuning and implementation |
| **Pole Placement** | State feedback design via pole placement |
| **Loop Shaping** | Frequency-domain controller design with Bode plot shaping |
| **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** | Constrained optimization-based control, with examples including energy systems |

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` — core scientific stack  
- `control` — Python control systems library  
- `cvxpy` — used for MPC and optimization-based examples  

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/guidosassaroli/controlbasics
```

## Who Is This For?

This project is ideal for:

- Control systems students learning through simulation
- Professors and TAs creating examples or assignments
- Engineers brushing up on core control theory concepts
- Anyone curious about how systems like cruise control, thermostats, or drones work under the hood
